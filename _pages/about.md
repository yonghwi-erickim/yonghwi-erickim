I am a postdoctoral researcher at Yonsei University, where I also received my Ph.D. in EE/CS. My research focuses on intelligent, machine learning-driven systems and low-complexity signal processing for next-generation wireless networks, including protocol design and physical-layer techniques.

My interests span radio resource management (RRM), PHY/MAC/RRC protocols, and emerging technologies such as full-duplex (FD) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). I received first prize in the IEEE ComSoc 4-Minute Thesis Competition, am a five-time winner of the Samsung Humantech Paper Award, and have presented prototyping work at IEEE GLOBECOM three times. I hold five patents (including a U.S. patent) and have published in several top-tier journals, with one paper ranked in the top 0.4% of JCR.
