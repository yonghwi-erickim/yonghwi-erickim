I am a Post. Doc. student at Yonsei University, Korea. I recieved Ph. D. from [Intelligence Networking Lab.](cbchae.org) I am conducting research on intelligent, machine learning-driven systems and practical low-complexity signal processing algorithms for next-generation wireless networks, with a focus on both the development of advanced communication protocols and physical layer signal processing. 

Prior to joining the lab, I earned a B.E. from the School of Integrated Technology at Yonsei University with a full scholarship. My research interests include radio resource management (RRM), protocols for PHY/MAC/RRC layer, as well as feasibility studies for emerging concepts such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and full-duplex (FD) systems. I am a 5-time winner of the Humantech Paper Award and have exhibited prototyping work at IEEE GLOBECOM 3 times. Additionally, I have collaborated on standardization-related research with industry partners, hold 5 patents including a US patent. I have also published work in several Q1 journals (3 published, 2 under review), with one of my papers ranked in the top 0.4% of the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) as the main author.
